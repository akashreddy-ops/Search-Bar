🔍 Creating a Search Bar Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
A search bar is an essential feature for any website, allowing users to quickly find information by entering keywords. I built a fully functional search bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that dynamically filters results as users type. 🚀

🌟 How Does It Work?
1️⃣ User enters a keyword into the search bar.
2️⃣ JavaScript filters the available content (like a list, table, or items) based on the input.
3️⃣ Matching results are displayed in real-time, making searching faster and more efficient.
4️⃣ If no matches are found, a message like "No results found" is shown.

🎯 Features of the Search Bar:
✅ Real-time filtering – Updates results as the user types.
✅ Case-insensitive search – Works regardless of uppercase or lowercase letters.
✅ User-friendly design – Styled using CSS for a clean and responsive look.
✅ Lightweight & fast – No need for complex databases; works directly on frontend data.

📌 Why is a Search Bar Important?
🔹 Enhances User Experience (UX): Helps users find content quickly.
🔹 Saves Time: No need to scroll through long lists or pages.
🔹 Boosts Engagement: Users are more likely to stay on a website when navigation is smooth.
